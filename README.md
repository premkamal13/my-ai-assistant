# __my-ai-assistant__
A Python based AI assistant that talks to you and answers mathematical and GK queries

# __How to run__

Setup 
- Login to Wolfram Alpha and get an app-id
- Put that app-id in config\_writer.py
- Run *python3.6 config\_writer.py*

*The API key has a limit of 2000 hits per day. So, I need to request you to please use your own app-id. It's fairly simple and just a few clicks here: http://developer.wolframalpha.com.*

Running the main program
- Navigate to src
- Run **python3.6 assist_me.py**


# __Sample Queries__

- 10^100
- x + 2y = 10 , 3x + y = 20
- Who is Barack Obama
- What is Facebook
- George Bush
- Tell me about Indo-Pak treaty


# __Background__

My little cousin sister (a class 7 student) is not a fan of Mathematics. I made this assistant to make the subject more fun and involving for her.
She still doesn't love the subject so much, but she is happy to have a helping hand. 

One day she queried her with "10^1000". And not just once!
- Try it at your own risk. You can if you need some background music to beat box.

Supporting querying of General Knowledge as a feature was not asked for by her, bbut it made her a bit more cool, so I had that added!
