__Background__

My little cousin sister (a class 7 student) is not a fan of Mathematics. I made this assistant to make the subject more fun and involving for her.
She still doesn't love the subject so much, but she is happy to have a helping hand. 
*Caution*
One day she queried her with "10^1000". And not just once!
- Try it at your own risk. Well, you can if you need some continuous background music to beat box.

Supporting General Knowledge Querying as a feature was not asked for by her, bbut it made her a bit more cool, so I had that added!
